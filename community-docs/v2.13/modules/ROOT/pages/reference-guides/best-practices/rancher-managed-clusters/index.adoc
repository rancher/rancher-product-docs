== Logging

Refer to xref:reference-guides/best-practices/rancher-managed-clusters/logging-best-practices.adoc[this guide] for our recommendations for cluster-level logging and application logging.

== Monitoring

Configuring sensible monitoring and alerting rules is vital for running any production workloads securely and reliably. Refer to this xref:reference-guides/best-practices/rancher-managed-clusters/monitoring-best-practices.adoc[guide] for our recommendations.

== Disconnected clusters

Rancher supports managing clusters that may not always be online due to network disruptions, control plane availability, or because all cluster nodes are down. Refer to this xref:reference-guides/best-practices/rancher-managed-clusters/disconnected-clusters.adoc[guide] for our recommendations.

== Tips for Setting Up Containers

Running well-built containers can greatly impact the overall performance and security of your environment. Refer to this xref:reference-guides/best-practices/rancher-managed-clusters/tips-to-set-up-containers.adoc[guide] for tips.

== Best Practices for Rancher Managed VMware vSphere Clusters

This xref:reference-guides/best-practices/rancher-managed-clusters/rancher-managed-clusters-in-vsphere.adoc[guide] outlines a reference architecture for provisioning downstream Rancher clusters in a vSphere environment, in addition to standard vSphere best practices as documented by VMware.
