= Using API Tokens

Rancher v2.8.0 introduced the xref:api/api-reference.adoc[Rancher Kubernetes API] which can be used to manage Rancher resources through `kubectl`. This page covers information on API tokens used with the xref:rancher-admin/cli/rancher-cli.adoc[Rancher CLI], xref:cluster-admin/manage-clusters/access-clusters/authorized-cluster-endpoint.adoc#_about_the_kubeconfig_file[kubeconfig files], Terraform and the xref:api/v3-rancher-api-guide.adoc#_enable_view_in_api[v3 API browser].

By default, some cluster-level API tokens are generated with infinite time-to-live (`ttl=0`). In other words, API tokens with `ttl=0` never expire unless you invalidate them. Tokens are not invalidated by changing a password.

You can deactivate API tokens by deleting them or by deactivating the user account.

== Deleting Tokens

To delete a token:

. Go to the list of all tokens in the Rancher API view at `https://<Rancher-Server-IP>/v3/tokens`.
. Access the token you want to delete by its ID. For example, `https://<Rancher-Server-IP>/v3/tokens/kubectl-shell-user-vqkqt`
. Click *Delete*.

The following is a complete list of tokens generated with `ttl=0`:

|===
| Token | Description

| `kubectl-shell-*`
| Access to `kubectl` shell in the browser

| `agent-*`
| Token for agent deployment

| `compose-token-*`
| Token for compose

| `helm-token-*`
| Token for Helm chart deployment

| `telemetry-*`
| Telemetry token

| `drain-node-*`
| Token for drain (Rancher uses `kubectl` for drain because there is no native Kubernetes API).

== Setting TTL on Kubeconfig Tokens

Admins can set a global time-to-live (TTL) on Kubeconfig tokens. Changing the default kubeconfig TTL can be done by navigating to global settings and setting <<_kubeconfig_default_token_ttl_minutes,`kubeconfig-default-token-ttl-minutes`>> to the desired duration in minutes. As of Rancher v2.8, the default value of <<_kubeconfig_default_token_ttl_minutes,`kubeconfig-default-token-ttl-minutes`>> is `43200`, which means that tokens expire in 30 days.

[NOTE]
====

This setting is used by all kubeconfig tokens except those created by the CLI to <<_disable_tokens_in_generated_kubeconfigs,generate kubeconfig tokens>>.
====


== Disable Tokens in Generated Kubeconfigs

Set the `kubeconfig-generate-token` setting to `false`. This setting instructs Rancher to no longer automatically generate a token when a user clicks on download a kubeconfig file. When this setting is deactivated, a generated kubeconfig references the xref:rancher-admin/cli/kubectl.adoc#_authentication_with_kubectl_and_kubeconfig_tokens_with_ttl[Rancher CLI] to retrieve a short-lived token for the cluster. When this kubeconfig is used in a client, such as `kubectl`, the Rancher CLI needs to be installed to complete the log in request.

== Token Hashing

You can xref:rancher-admin/experimental-features/experimental-features.adoc[enable token hashing], where tokens undergo a one-way hash using the SHA256 algorithm. This is a non-reversible process: once enabled, this feature cannot be disabled. You should first evaluate this setting in a test environment, and/or take backups before enabling.

This feature affects all tokens which include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Kubeconfig tokens
* Bearer tokens API keys/calls
* Tokens used by internal operations

== Token Settings

These global settings affect Rancher token behavior.

|===
| Setting | Description

| <<_auth_user_session_ttl_minutes,`auth-user-session-ttl-minutes`>>
| TTL in minutes on a user auth session token.

| <<_kubeconfig_default_token_ttl_minutes,`kubeconfig-default-token-ttl-minutes`>>
| Default TTL applied to all kubeconfig tokens except for tokens <<_disable_tokens_in_generated_kubeconfigs,generated by Rancher CLI>>.

| <<_auth_token_max_ttl_minutes,`auth-token-max-ttl-minutes`>>
| Max TTL for all tokens except those controlled by <<_auth_user_session_ttl_minutes,`auth-user-session-ttl-minutes`>>.

| <<_kubeconfig_generate_token,`kubeconfig-generate-token`>>
| If true, automatically generate tokens when a user downloads a kubeconfig.
|===

=== auth-user-session-ttl-minutes

Time to live (TTL) duration in minutes, used to determine when a user auth session token expires. When expired, the user must log in and obtain a new token. This setting is not affected by <<_auth_token_max_ttl_minutes,`auth-token-max-ttl-minutes`>>. Session tokens are created when a user logs into Rancher.

=== kubeconfig-default-token-ttl-minutes

Time to live (TTL) duration in minutes, used to determine when a kubeconfig token expires. When the token is expired, the API rejects the token. This setting can't be larger than <<_auth_token_max_ttl_minutes,`auth-token-max-ttl-minutes`>>. This setting applies to tokens generated in a requested kubeconfig file, except for tokens <<_disable_tokens_in_generated_kubeconfigs,generated by Rancher CLI>>. As of Rancher v2.8, the default duration is `43200`, which means that tokens expire in 30 days.

=== auth-token-max-ttl-minutes

Maximum Time to Live (TTL) in minutes allowed for auth tokens. If a user attempts to create a token with a TTL greater than `auth-token-max-ttl-minutes`, Rancher sets the token TTL to the value of `auth-token-max-ttl-minutes`. Applies to all kubeconfig tokens and API tokens. As of Rancher v2.8, the default duration is `129600`, which means that tokens expire in 90 days.

=== kubeconfig-generate-token

When true, kubeconfigs requested through the UI contain a valid token. When false, kubeconfigs contain a command that uses the Rancher CLI to prompt the user to log in. xref:rancher-admin/cli/kubectl.adoc#_authentication_with_kubectl_and_kubeconfig_tokens_with_ttl[The CLI then retrieves and caches a token for the user].
