* Only a user with the `cluster-admin` https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles[Kubernetes default role] assigned can configure and install Istio in a Kubernetes cluster.
* If you have pod security policies, you will need to install Istio with the CNI enabled. For details, see xref:observability/istio/configuration/pod-security-policies.adoc[this section.]
* To install Istio on an RKE2 cluster, additional steps are required. For details, see xref:observability/istio/configuration/install-istio-on-rke2-cluster.adoc[this section.]
* To install Istio in a cluster where project network isolation is enabled, additional steps are required. For details, see xref:observability/istio/configuration/project-network-isolation.adoc[this section.]
