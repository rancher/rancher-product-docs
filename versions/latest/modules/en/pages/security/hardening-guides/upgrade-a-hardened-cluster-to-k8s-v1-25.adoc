= Upgrading a Hardened Custom/Imported Cluster to Kubernetes v1.25

Kubernetes v1.25 changes how clusters describe and implement security policies. From this version forward, https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/[Pod Security Policies (PSPs)] are no longer available. Kubernetes v1.25 replaces them with new security objects: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/[Pod Security Standards (PSS)], and https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/[Pod Security Admissions (PSAs)].

If you have custom or imported hardened clusters, you must take special preparations to ensure that the upgrade from an earlier version of Kubernetes to v1.25 or later goes smoothly.

[NOTE]
====

After you upgrade to v1.25, add the necessary Rancher namespace exemptions. See xref:security/psact.adoc#_exempting_required_rancher_namespaces[Pod Security Admission (PSA) Configuration Templates] for more details.
