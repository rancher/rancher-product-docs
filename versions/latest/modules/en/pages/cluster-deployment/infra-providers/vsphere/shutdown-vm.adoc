= Graceful Shutdown for VMware vSphere Virtual Machines
:experimental:

In Rancher v2.8.3 and later, you can configure the graceful shutdown of virtual machines (VMs) for VMware vSphere node driver clusters. Graceful shutdown introduces a delay before the VM is forcibly deleted, which allows time for terminating any running processes and open connections.

In RKE2/K3s, you can set up graceful shutdown when you create the cluster, or edit the cluster configuration to add it afterward.

In RKE, you can edit node templates to similar results.

[NOTE]
====

Since Rancher can't detect the platform of an imported cluster, you cannot enable graceful shutdown on VMware vSphere clusters you have imported.

In RKE2/K3s, you can configure new VMware vSphere clusters with graceful shutdown for VMs:

. Click *☰ > Cluster Management*.
. Click *Create* and select *VMware vSphere* to provision a new cluster.
. Under menu:Machine Pools[Scheduling], in the *Graceful Shutdown Timeout* field, enter an integer value greater than 0. The value you enter is the amount of time in seconds Rancher waits before deleting VMs on the cluster. If the value is set to `0`, graceful shutdown is disabled.

. Click *☰ > Cluster Management*.
. From the left navigation, select menu:RKE1 Configuration[Node Templates].
. Click *Add Template* and select *vSphere* to create a node template.
. Under *2. Scheduling*, in the *Graceful Shutdown Timeout* field, enter an integer value greater than 0. The value you enter is the amount of time in seconds Rancher waits before deleting VMs on the cluster. If the value is set to `0`, graceful shutdown is disabled.

When you xref:cluster-deployment/infra-providers/infra-providers.adoc[use the newly-created node template to create node pools], the nodes will gracefully shutdown of VMs according to the *Graceful Shutdown Timeout* value you have set.

== Enable Graceful Shutdown in Existing RKE2/K3s Clusters

In RKE2/K3s, you can edit the configuration of an existing VMware vSphere cluster to enable graceful shutdown, which adds a delay before deleting VMs.

. Click *☰ > Cluster Management*.
. On the *Clusters* page, find the VMware vSphere hosted cluster you want to edit. Click *⋮* at the end of the row associated with the cluster. Select *Edit Config*.
. Under menu:Machine Pools[Scheduling], in the *Graceful Shutdown Timeout* field, enter an integer value greater than 0. The value you enter is the amount of time in seconds Rancher waits before deleting VMs on the cluster. If the value is set to `0`, graceful shutdown is disabled.

== Enable Graceful Shutdown in Existing RKE Clusters

In RKE, you can't directly edit an existing cluster's configuration to add graceful shutdown to existing VMware vSphere clusters. However, you can edit the configuration of existing node templates. As noted in xref:rancher-admin/users/settings/manage-node-templates.adoc#_updating_a_node_template[Updating a Node Template], all node pools using the node template automatically use the updated information when new nodes are added to the cluster.

To edit an existing node template to enable graceful shutdown:

. Click *☰ > Cluster Management*.
. From the left navigation, select menu:RKE1 Configuration[Node Templates].
. Find the VMware vSphere node template you want to edit. Click *⋮* at the end of the row associated with the template. Select *Edit*.
. Under *2. Scheduling*, in the *Graceful Shutdown Timeout* field, enter an integer value greater than 0. The value you enter is the amount of time in seconds Rancher waits before deleting VMs on the cluster. If the value is set to `0`, graceful shutdown is disabled.
. Click *Save*.
