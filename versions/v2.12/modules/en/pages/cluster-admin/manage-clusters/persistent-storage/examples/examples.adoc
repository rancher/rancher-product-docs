Rancher supports persistent storage with a variety of volume plugins. However, before you use any of these plugins to bind persistent storage to your workloads, you have to configure the storage itself, whether its a cloud-based solution from a service-provider or an on-prem solution that you manage yourself.

For your convenience, Rancher offers documentation on how to configure some of the popular storage methods:
