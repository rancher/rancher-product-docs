`kubectl` is a CLI utility for running commands against Kubernetes clusters. It's required for many maintenance and administrative tasks in Rancher 2.x.

== Installation

See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[kubectl Installation] for installation on your operating system.

== Configuration

When you create a Kubernetes cluster with RKE2/K3s, the Kubeconfig file is stored at `/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml` or `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` depending on your chosen distribution. These files are used to configure access to the Kubernetes cluster.

Test your connectivity with `kubectl` and see if you can get the list of nodes back.
