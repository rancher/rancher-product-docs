:description: Read about port requirements needed in order for Rancher to operate properly, both for Rancher nodes and downstream Kubernetes cluster nodes

To operate properly, Rancher requires a number of ports to be open on Rancher nodes and on downstream Kubernetes cluster nodes.

== Rancher Nodes

The following table lists the ports that need to be open to and from nodes that are running the Rancher server.

The port requirements differ based on the Rancher server architecture.

Rancher can be installed on any Kubernetes cluster. For Rancher installs on a K3s or RKE2 Kubernetes cluster, refer to the tabs below. For other Kubernetes distributions, refer to the distribution's documentation for the port requirements for cluster nodes.

[NOTE]
.Notes:
====
* Rancher nodes may also require additional outbound access for any external authentication provider which is configured (LDAP for example).
* Kubernetes recommends TCP 30000-32767 for node port services.
* For firewalls, traffic may need to be enabled within the cluster and pod CIDR.
* Rancher nodes may also need outbound access to an external S3 location which is used for storing cluster backups (Minio for example).

=== Ports for Rancher Server Nodes on {k3s-product-name}

.Click to expand
[%collapsible]
======
The K3s server needs port 6443 to be accessible by the nodes.

The nodes need to be able to reach other nodes over UDP port 8472 when Flannel VXLAN is used. The node should not listen on any other port. K3s uses reverse tunneling such that the nodes make outbound connections to the server and all kubelet traffic runs through that tunnel. However, if you do not use Flannel and provide your own custom CNI, then port 8472 is not needed by K3s.

If you wish to utilize the metrics server, you will need to open port 10250 on each node.

[NOTE]
.Important:
====
The VXLAN port on nodes should not be exposed to the world as it opens up your cluster network to be accessed by anyone. Run your nodes behind a firewall/security group that disables access to port 8472.

The following tables break down the port requirements for inbound and outbound traffic:

== Downstream Kubernetes Cluster Nodes

Downstream Kubernetes clusters run your apps and services. This section describes what ports need to be opened on the nodes in downstream clusters so that Rancher can communicate with them.

The port requirements differ depending on how the downstream cluster was launched. Each of the tabs below list the ports that need to be opened for different xref:cluster-deployment/cluster-deployment.adoc[cluster types].

The following diagram depicts the ports that are opened for each xref:cluster-deployment/cluster-deployment.adoc[cluster type].

[TIP]
====

If security isn't a large concern and you're okay with opening a few additional ports, you can use the table in <<_commonly_used_ports,Commonly Used Ports>> as your port reference instead of the comprehensive tables below.

== Other Port Considerations

=== Commonly Used Ports

These ports are typically opened on your Kubernetes nodes, regardless of what type of cluster it is.

include::shared:ROOT:partial$en/common-ports-table.adoc[]

'''

=== Local Node Traffic

Ports marked as `local traffic` (i.e., `9099 TCP`) in the above requirements are used for Kubernetes healthchecks (`livenessProbe` and``readinessProbe``).
These healthchecks are executed on the node itself. In most cloud environments, this local traffic is allowed by default.

However, this traffic may be blocked when:

* You have applied strict host firewall policies on the node.
* You are using nodes that have multiple interfaces (multihomed).

In these cases, you have to explicitly allow this traffic in your host firewall, or in case of public/private cloud hosted machines (i.e. AWS or OpenStack), in your security group configuration. Keep in mind that when using a security group as source or destination in your security group, explicitly opening ports only applies to the private interface of the nodes / instances.

=== Rancher AWS EC2 Security Group

When using the xref:cluster-deployment/infra-providers/aws/aws.adoc[AWS EC2 node driver] to provision cluster nodes in Rancher, you can choose to let Rancher create a security group called `rancher-nodes`. The following rules are automatically added to this security group.

=== Opening SUSE Linux Ports

SUSE Linux may have a firewall that blocks all ports by default. To open the ports needed for adding the host to a custom cluster,

[tabs]
======
SLES 15 / openSUSE Leap 15::
+
--
. SSH into the instance.
. Start YaST in text mode:
+
----
 sudo yast2
----

. Navigate to *Security and Users* > *Firewall* > *Zones:public* > *Ports*. To navigate within the interface, follow these https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/reference/html/book-reference/cha-yast-text.html#sec-yast-cli-navigate[instructions].
. To open the required ports, enter them into the *TCP Ports* and *UDP Ports* fields. In this example, ports 9796 and 10250 are also opened for monitoring. The resulting fields should look similar to the following:
+
[,yaml]
----
 TCP Ports
 22, 80, 443, 2376, 2379, 2380, 6443, 9099, 9796, 10250, 10254, 30000-32767
 UDP Ports
 8472, 30000-32767
----

. When all required ports are enter, select *Accept*.
--

SLES 12 / openSUSE Leap 42::
+
--
. SSH into the instance.
. Edit /`etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2` and open the required ports. In this example, ports 9796 and 10250 are also opened for monitoring:
+
----
 FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP="22 80 443 2376 2379 2380 6443 9099 9796 10250 10254 30000:32767"
 FW_SERVICES_EXT_UDP="8472 30000:32767"
 FW_ROUTE=yes
----

. Restart the firewall with the new ports:
+
----
 SuSEfirewall2
----
--
======

*Result:* The node has the open ports required to be added to a custom cluster.
