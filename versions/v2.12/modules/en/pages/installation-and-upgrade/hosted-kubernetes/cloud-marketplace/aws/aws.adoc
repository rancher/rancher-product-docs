== Overview

Rancher offers an integration with the AWS Marketplace which allows users to purchase a support contract with SUSE. This integration allows you easily adjust your support needs as you start to support more clusters.

== Limitations

* You must be running Rancher v2.6.7 or higher
* Rancher must be deployed with additional metrics enabled.
* Rancher must be installed on an EKS cluster.
* You must purchase at least one entitlement to Rancher support through AWS Marketplace.
* You may need additional setup to support proxy/airgap use cases. See the xref:installation-and-upgrade/hosted-kubernetes/cloud-marketplace/aws/adapter-requirements.adoc[prerequisites] for more information.

== How to Use

. Complete the xref:installation-and-upgrade/hosted-kubernetes/cloud-marketplace/aws/adapter-requirements.adoc[prerequisite steps].
. xref:installation-and-upgrade/hosted-kubernetes/cloud-marketplace/aws/install-adapter.adoc[Install the CSP Adapter].

== FAQ

*Can I purchase support for more nodes later on?*

Yes. Simply go to the AWS Marketplace entry that you used to initially purchase support and increase the number of entitlements.

*Can I use multiple instances of Rancher in the same AWS account?*

Yes. However, each cluster that Rancher is installed in will need to adhere to the prerequisites.

In addition, keep in mind that a given entitlement can only be used by one Rancher management server at a time.
