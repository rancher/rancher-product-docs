| https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-4h45-jpvh-6p5j[CVE-2024-58259] 
| POSTs to the Rancher API endpoints are now limited to 1 Mi; this is configurable through the settings if you need a larger limit. The Rancher authentication endpoints are configured independently of the main public API (as you might need bigger payloads in the other API endpoints). Suppose you need to increase the maximum allowed payload for authentication. In that case, you can set the environment variable `CATTLE_AUTH_API_BODY_LIMIT` to a quantity, e.g., 2 Mi, which would allow larger payloads for the authentication endpoints.

| https://github.com/rancher/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-xgpc-q899-67p8[CVE-2025-23390] 
a| This vulnerability only affects customers using xref:integrations/fleet/fleet.adoc[Continuous Delivery with Fleet] where Fleet does not validate a server's certificate when connecting through SSH. This can allow for a main-in-the-middle-attack against Fleet. The fix provides a new `insecureSkipHostKeyChecks` value for the `fleet` Helm chart. The default value is set to *`true` (opt-in) for Rancher v2.9 - v2.11* for backward compatibility. The default value is set to *`false` (opt-out) for Rancher v2.12 and later*, and Fleet v0.13 and later.

`true` (opt-in):
    
If `insecureSkipHostKeyChecks` is set to `true`, then not finding any matching `known_hosts` entry for an SSH host will not lead to any error. Please note, regardless of the configuration setting, if the `known-hosts` ConfigMap is deleted it will lead to errors as it will be considered a symptom of an incomplete Fleet deployment.

`false` (opt-out):

If `insecureSkipHostKeyChecks` is set to `false`, then strict host key checks are enabled. When enabled, the checks ensure that when using SSH, Fleet rejects connection attempts to hosts not matching any entry found in (decreasing order of precedence):

* A secret referenced by name in a `GitRepo` which is located in the same `GitRepo's` namespace.
* If no such secret name is provided, in a `gitcredential` secret located in the same namespace.
* A new `known-hosts` ConfigMap, created during the Fleet chart installation time and located in the namespace `cattle-fleet-system`.

This happens regardless of whether a `GitRepo` uses an SSH URL to point to a Git repository since, once cloned, a repository may be found to contain external resources to be retrieved, such as Helm artifacts.

A limitation with the default `known_hosts` entries is that they are only provided for GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket and Azure DevOps hosts. If you need to connect to a different host, or if key fingerprints for the provided entries are updated, the following options are available:

* Manually update the default `known-hosts` ConfigMap.
* Reference a secret from your `GitRepo` resources, containing the updated or additional `known_hosts` entries.
* Create a `gitcredential` secret containing the entries for `GitRepo` resources that do not already reference a secret.

| https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-8h6m-wv39-239m[CVE-2024-22031] | A vulnerability was found where users could create a project and then gain access to arbitrary projects. As a fix, a new field has been added to projects called the `BackingNampespace`, which represents the namespace created for a project containing all resources needed for project operations. This includes resources such as ProjectRoleTemplateBindings, project-scoped secrets and workloads.

    The field is populated automatically during project creation and is formatted as `<clusterID>-<project.Name>`. For example, if your project is named `project-abc123` in a cluster with ID `cluster-xyz789`, then the project will have the `BackingNampespace`: `cluster-xyz789-project-abc123`. Existing projects will not be migrated and only newly created projects will have the new namespace naming convention.

| https://github.com/rancher/steve/security/advisories/GHSA-95fc-g4gj-mqmx[CVE-2023-32198] | A vulnerability was found where users with permission to create a service in the Kubernetes cluster where Rancher is deployed can take over the Rancher UI, display their own UI, and gather sensitive information. This is only possible when the setting `ui-offline-preferred` is set to `remote`. This release introduces a patch, and the malicious user can no longer serve their own UI. If users can't upgrade, please make sure that only trustable users have access to create a service in the local cluster.

| https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-8p83-cpfg-fj3g[CVE-2025-23391] | A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher where a Restricted Administrator can change the password of Administrators and take over their accounts. A Restricted Administrator should not be allowed to change the password of more privileged users unless it contains the Manage Users permissions. A new validation has been added to block a user from editing or deleting another user with more permissions than themselves. Rancher deployments where the Restricted Administrator role is not being used are not affected by this CVE.

| https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-mq23-vvg7-xfm4[CVE-2025-23389]
a| A vulnerability in Rancher has been discovered, leading to a local user impersonation through SAML Authentication on first login.

The issue occurs when a SAML authentication provider (AP) is configured (e.g. Keycloak). A newly created AP user can impersonate any user on Rancher by manipulating cookie values during their initial login to Rancher. This vulnerability could also be exploited if a Rancher user (present on the AP) is removed, either manually or automatically via the xref:rancher-admin/users/authn-and-authz/enable-user-retention.adoc[User Retention feature] with delete-inactive-user-after

| https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-xr9q-h9c7-xw8q[CVE-2025-23388]
a| An unauthenticated stack overflow crash, leading to a denial of service (DoS), was identified in Rancher’s `/v3-public/authproviders` public API endpoint. A malicious user could submit data to the API which would cause the Rancher server to crash, but no malicious or incorrect data would actually be written in the API. The downstream clusters, i.e., the clusters managed by Rancher, are not affected by this issue.

This vulnerability affects those using external authentication providers as well as Rancher’s local authentication.

| https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-5qmp-9x47-92q8[CVE-2025-23387]
a| A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher where it is possible for an unauthenticated user to list all CLI authentication tokens and delete them before the CLI is able to get the token value. This effectively prevents users from logging in via the CLI when using rancher token as the execution command (instead of the token directly being in the kubeconfig).

Note that this token is not the kubeconfig token and if an attacker is able to intercept it they can't use it to impersonate a real user since it is encrypted.

| https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-h99m-6755-rgwc[CVE-2024-22036]
| A critical severity vulnerability was discovered within Rancher where a cluster or node driver can be used to escape the `chroot` jail and gain root access to the Rancher container itself. In production environments, further privilege escalation is possible based on living off the land within the Rancher container itself. For test and development environments, based on a –privileged Docker container, it is possible to escape the Docker container and gain execution access on the host system.

| https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-xj7w-r753-vj8v[CVE-2022-45157]
| A critical severity vulnerability was discovered in the way that Rancher stores vSphere's CPI (Cloud Provider Interface) and CSI (Container Storage Interface) credentials used to deploy clusters through the vSphere cloud provider. This issue leads to the vSphere CPI and CSI passwords being stored in a plaintext object inside Rancher. This vulnerability is only applicable to users that deploy clusters in vSphere environments. *Rancher v2.7 is vulnerable and hasn't received the fix*.

| https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-9833-v2p4[CVE-2024-22030] 
| A high severity vulnerability was discovered in Rancher's agents that under very specific circumstances allows a malicious actor to take over existing Rancher nodes. The attacker needs to have control of an expired domain or execute a DNS spoofing/hijacking attack against the domain in order to exploit this vulnerability. The targeted domain is the one used as the Rancher URL (the `server-url` of the Rancher cluster).
