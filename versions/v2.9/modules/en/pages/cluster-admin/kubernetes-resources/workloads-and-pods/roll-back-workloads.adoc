Sometimes there is a need to rollback to the previous version of the application, either for debugging purposes or because an upgrade did not go as planned.

. In the upper left corner, click *☰ > Cluster Management*.
. Go to the cluster where you want to upgrade a workload and click *Explore*.
. In the left navigation bar, click *Workload*.
. Find the workload that you want to rollback and select *⋮ > Rollback*.
. Choose the revision that you want to roll back to. Click *Rollback*.

*Result:* Your workload reverts to the previous version that you chose. Wait a few minutes for the action to complete.
