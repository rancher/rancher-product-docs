Many 3rd party integrations available for Kubernetes, such as GitLab and HashiCorp Vault, involve giving an external process access to the Kubernetes API using a native Kubernetes Service Account token for authentication.

In Rancher v2.9.0 and later, service accounts on downstream clusters can now authenticate through a JSON web token (JWT) using the Rancher authentication proxy. In Rancher versions earlier than  v2.9.0, only Rancher-issued tokens were supported.

To enable this feature, follow these steps:

. In the upper left corner, click *☰ > Cluster Management*.
. Click *Advanced* to open the dropdown menu.
. Select *JWT Authentication*.
. Click the checkbox for the cluster you want to enable JWT authentication for, and click *Enable*. Alternatively, you can click *⋮* > *Enable*.
