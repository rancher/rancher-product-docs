== Configuring Tools

Rancher contains a variety of tools that aren't included in Kubernetes to assist in your DevOps operations. Rancher can integrate with external services to help your clusters run more efficiently. Tools are divided into the following categories:

* Alerts
* Notifiers
* Logging
* Monitoring
* Istio Service Mesh
* OPA Gatekeeper

Tools can be installed through *Apps.*
