[CAUTION]
====
The Rancher Prime chart has been renamed from `rancher` to `rancher-prime` in Rancher v2.13.1. This may cause failures with clusters utilizing the ingress-nginx ingress controller. Please refer to this https://support.scc.suse.com/s/kb/Upgrade-to-Rancher-Prime-v2-13-1-fails-in-clusters-with-ingress-nginx?language=en_US[knowledge base article] to resolve issues during upgrade.
====

The following instructions will guide you through upgrading a Rancher server that was installed on a Kubernetes cluster with Helm. These steps also apply to air-gapped installs with Helm.

For the instructions to upgrade Rancher installed with Docker, refer to xref:[this page.]

== Prerequisites

=== Access to kubeconfig

Helm should be run from the same location as your kubeconfig file, or the same location where you run your kubectl commands from.

If you installed Kubernetes with RKE2/K3s, the Kubeconfig is stored in the `/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml` or `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` directory depending on your chosen distribution.

The kubeconfig can also be manually targeted for the intended cluster with the `--kubeconfig` tag (see: https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm/)

=== Review Known Issues

Review the list of known issues for each Rancher version, which can be found in the release notes on https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases[GitHub] and on the https://forums.rancher.com/c/announcements/12[Rancher forums.]

=== Helm Version

The upgrade instructions assume you are using Helm 3.

include::shared:ROOT:partial$en/deprecation-helm2.adoc[]

For migration of installs started with Helm 2, refer to the official https://helm.sh/blog/migrate-from-helm-v2-to-helm-v3/[Helm 2 to 3 migration docs.] The xref:[Helm 2 upgrade page here]provides a copy of the older upgrade instructions that used Helm 2, and it is intended to be used if upgrading to Helm 3 is not feasible.

=== For air-gapped installs: Populate private registry

For xref:installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/air-gapped/air-gapped.adoc[air-gapped installs only,] collect and populate images for the new Rancher server version. Follow the guide to xref:installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/air-gapped/publish-images.adoc[populate your private registry] with the images for the Rancher version that you want to upgrade to.

=== For upgrades with cert-manager older than 0.8.0

https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/blocking-old-cert-manager-versions/98753[Let's Encrypt will be blocking cert-manager instances older than 0.8.0 starting November 1st 2019.] Upgrade cert-manager to the latest version by following xref:installation-and-upgrade/resources/upgrade-cert-manager.adoc[these instructions.]

== Upgrade Outline

Follow the steps to upgrade Rancher server:

=== 1. Back up Your Kubernetes Cluster that is Running Rancher Server

Use the xref:rancher-admin/back-up-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up.adoc[backup application] to back up Rancher.

You'll use the backup as a restore point if something goes wrong during upgrade.

=== 2. Update the Helm chart repository

. Update your local Helm repo cache.
+
----
helm repo update
----

. Get the repository name that you used to install Rancher.
+
----
helm repo list

NAME          	       URL
rancher-prime          <helm-chart-repo-url>
----

. Fetch the latest chart to install Rancher from the Helm chart repository.
+
This command will pull down the latest charts and save it in the current directory as a `.tgz` file.
+
include::shared:ROOT:partial$en/rancher-chart-rename.adoc[]
+
[,plain]
----
 helm fetch rancher-prime/rancher-prime
----
+
You can fetch the chart for the specific version you are upgrading to by adding in the `--version=` tag.  For example:
+
include::shared:ROOT:partial$en/rancher-chart-rename.adoc[]
+
[,plain]
----
 helm fetch rancher-prime/rancher-prime --version=2.6.8
----

=== 3. Upgrade Rancher

This section describes how to upgrade normal (Internet-connected) or air-gapped installations of Rancher with Helm.

[NOTE]
.Air Gap Instructions:
====

If you are installing Rancher in an air-gapped environment, skip the rest of this page and render the Helm template by following the instructions on xref:installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/air-gapped/upgrades.adoc[this page.]
====


Get the values, which were passed with `--set`, from the current Rancher Helm chart that is installed.

----
helm get values rancher -n cattle-system

hostname: rancher.my.org
----

[NOTE]
====

There will be more values that are listed with this command. This is just an example of one of the values.
====


[TIP]
====

Your deployment name may vary; for example, if you're deploying Rancher through the AWS Marketplace, the deployment name is 'rancher-prime'.
Thus:

----
helm get values rancher-prime -n cattle-system

hostname: rancher.my.org
----
====


If you are upgrading cert-manager to the latest version from v1.5 or below, follow the xref:installation-and-upgrade/resources/upgrade-cert-manager.adoc#_option_c_upgrade_cert_manager_from_versions_15_and_below[cert-manager upgrade docs] to learn how to upgrade cert-manager without needing to perform an uninstall or reinstall of Rancher. Otherwise, follow the <<_steps_to_upgrade_rancher,steps to upgrade Rancher>> below.

==== Steps to Upgrade Rancher

Upgrade Rancher to the latest version with all your settings.

Take all the values from the previous step and append them to the command using `--set key=value`.

include::shared:ROOT:partial$en/rancher-chart-rename.adoc[]

----
helm upgrade rancher rancher-prime/rancher-prime \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=rancher.my.org
----

[NOTE]
====

The above is an example, there may be more values from the previous step that need to be appended.
====


[TIP]
====
If you deploy Rancher through the AWS Marketplace, the deployment name is 'rancher-prime'.
Thus:

----
helm upgrade rancher-prime rancher-prime/rancher-prime \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=rancher.my.org
----
====


Alternatively, it's possible to export the current values to a file and reference that file during upgrade. For example, to only change the Rancher version:

. Export the current values to a file:
+
----
 helm get values rancher -n cattle-system -o yaml > values.yaml
----

. Update only the Rancher version:
+
include::shared:ROOT:partial$en/rancher-chart-rename.adoc[]
+
----
 helm upgrade rancher rancher-prime/rancher-prime \
   --namespace cattle-system \
   -f values.yaml \
   --version=2.6.8
----

=== 4. Verify the Upgrade

Log into Rancher to confirm that the upgrade succeeded.

[TIP]
====

Having network issues following upgrade?

See xref:[Restoring Cluster Networking].

== Known Upgrade Issues

A list of known issues for each Rancher version can be found in the release notes on https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases[GitHub] and on the https://forums.rancher.com/c/announcements/12[Rancher forums.]
