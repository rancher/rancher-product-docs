[CAUTION]
====
RoleTemplate aggregation is an experimental feature in v2.13 that changes the RBAC architecture used for RoleTemplates, ClusterRoleTemplateBindings and ProjectRoleTemplateBindings. **It is not supported for production environments**. Breaking changes may occur between v2.13 and v2.14.
====

RoleTemplate aggregation implements RoleTemplates, ClusterRoleTemplateBindings and ProjectRoleTemplateBindings using the Kubernetes feature https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#aggregated-clusterroles[Aggregated ClusterRoles]. The new architecture results in a net reduction in RBAC objects (Roles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings) both in the Rancher cluster and the downstream clusters.

For more information on how the feature can improve scalability and performance, please see the https://www.suse.com/c/rancher_blog/fewer-bindings-more-power-ranchers-rbac-boost-for-enhanced-performance-and-scalability/[Rancher Blog post].
